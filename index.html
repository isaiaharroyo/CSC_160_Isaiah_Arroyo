Music
</h1>

<p>
Of the many things that has continuously evolved throughout my life, from the effervescence and inexperience of youth, to the maturity
and stability of adulthood has been my library of music.
</p>

<p>
I grew up with a more conservative taste in music, limiting myself to a set number of artists and genres. It wasn't until High School
that I found that the best way to enjoy the experience of music is by exploring new artists and sounds that I would have previously thought
of as bizzare or odd.
