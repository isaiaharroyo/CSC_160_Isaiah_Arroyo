  <dt><h2>Collaboration</h2></dt>
  <dd>One of the most important aspects about a career as a Software Engineer
  described by Mayuko in the video is collaboration. This was something that she 
  did not expect to be so common, however, she instead finds herself communicating her projects
  with other engineers more often then not. This reflects the "Pair up" section of the syllabus,
  which emphasizes the importance of communication between classmates to help solve a problem.</dd>
  
  <dt><h2>Culture of Feedback</h2></dt>
  <dd>Another important aspect of Mayuko's job as discussed in the video was the code review. It
  is important that the code is reviewed numerous times before it is finally sent off. This represents
  the "Peer Assessed" part of the syllabus. This allows for one's peers to examine the code and 
  comment on it, presenting the individual with an opportunity to learn from any of their mistakes 
  and effectively helps them become better computer scientists.</dd>
