  <dt><h2>Collaboration</h2></dt>
  <dd>One of the most important aspects about a career as a Software Engineer
  described by Mayuko in the video is collaboration. This was something that she 
  did not expect to be very common in her field, however, she finds herself communicating her projects
  with other engineers more often than not. This reflects the "Pair up" section of the syllabus,
  which emphasizes the importance of communication between classmates to help solve problems.</dd>
  
  <dt><h2>Culture of Feedback</h2></dt>
  <dd>Another important aspect of Mayuko's job as discussed in the video was the code review. It
  is important that the code is reviewed numerous times before it is finally sent off. This represents
  the "Peer Assessed" part of the syllabus. This allows for one's peers to examine the code and 
  comment on it, presenting the individual with an opportunity to learn from any of their mistakes 
  and effectively helps them become better computer scientists. This also helps the entire class progress
  through the entire year because </dd>
  
  <dt><h2>Additional Information</h2></dt>
  <dd>Mayuko added something interesting in the video that I believe is important to include in the syllabus.
  She pointed out that while it is important to have strong programming skills, it is also harder to develop soft skills
  when already in the software engineering field. Therefore, I believe that another objective in the class is 
  that students also gain experience in teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal skills.</dd>
